DRGS

implants cylindrical stimulating electrode in the intraforaminal epidural space above the DRG
due to compactness of intraforaminal space and scarcity of CSF aroudn ganglion, electrode remains close in proximity to the DRG without migration
dermatome-specific pain relief
approved by FDA in 2016 to treat intractable complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) of the lower limbs
used off-label for other pain etiologies (phantom limb pain, painful diabetic neuropathy, groin pain)
do not understand mechanism of action of pain relief
therefore, cannot optimize clinical parameters (stimulation amplitude, electrode lead position) to maximize pain relief

[[spinal cord stimulation]]

several hypotheses to explain therapeutic mechanism of DRGS
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6692908/#R5
no clinical evidence directly supporting any one hypothesis
C-type fibers exhibit a low-pass filtering effect at the T-junction that prevents some peripherally-generated noxious afferent signals from reaching the central axon branch leading to the spinal cord
suggest that extracellular electrical stimulation can enhance this filtering effect
clinical DRGS may provide pain relief by augmenting this mechanism
however, stimulation amplitudes required to produce filtering (approximately 9.5 mA) were far outside clinical ranges (typically <1 mA), suggesting that DRGS provides pain relief through other mechanisms in clinical contexts
well understood that extracellular stimulation preferentially activates large-diameter myelinated axons over small nonmyelinated axons, suggests that Abeta fibers and not C-fibers may be directly stimulated by DRGS


developed a computer model of clinical DRGS
volume conductor model of human L5 DRG, common stimulation target to manage chronic foot pain
coupled this anatomical model to multi-compartment models of Abeta- and C fibers
showed that at stimulation amplitudes within typical clinical ranges, electrical stimulation is driving the activity of Abeta-fibers but not activating C-fibers
suggest that DRGS may provide pain relief by activating pain-gating mechanisms within the dorsal horn
suggest that straddling the active and return electrodes over the ganglion may be the optimal electrode configuration for activating neural tissue


# Methods

We constructed a three-dimensional finite element model based on experimentally measured values to create an anatomically- and electrically-accurate volume conductor model of human L5 DRG
geometry of the model owas based on published cadaver and imaging studies of the DRG and surrounding anatomy
electrical conductivity of each tissue was based on values used in previous computational studies of neurostimulation for pain and experimentally-measured tissue resistivities
