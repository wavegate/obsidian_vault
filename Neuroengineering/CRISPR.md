clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats

genetic engineering technique in by which genomes of living organisms may be modified, based on the bacterial CRISPR-Cas9 antiviral defense system
by delivering Cas9 nuclease complexed with a synthetic guide RNA (gRNA) into a cell, the cell's genome can be cut at adesired location, allowing existing genes to be removed and/or new ones added *in vivo*
