an equation system is in reduced row-echelon form if
- it is in row-echelon form
- every pivot is 1
- the pivot is the only nonzero entry in its column

Take the matrix $\begin{bmatrix}1&3&0&0&3\\0&0&1&0&9\\0&0&0&1&-4\end{bmatrix}$
Look at the non-pivot columns, which you express as a combination of the pivot columns
The second column is 3 times the first column
Therefore, to obtain 0, we need to subtract the second column from three times the first column
