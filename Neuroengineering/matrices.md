# Definition
With $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$ a real-valued $(m,n)$ matrix $A$ is an $m\cdot n$ tuple of elements $a_{ij},i=1,...,m,j=1,...,n$, which is ordered according to a rectangular scheme consisting of $m$ rows and $n$ columns:
$A = \begin{bmatrix}a_{11}&a_{12}&\cdots&a_{1n}\\a_{21}&a_{22}&\cdots&a_{2n}\\\vdots&\vdots&&\vdots\
