1) Electrons enter positive terminal
2) Electron combines with manganese oxide and water, releasing hydroxide
3) Hydroxide combines with zinc to create zinc hydroxide, releasing water and electrons
4) Hydroxide + Zinc (oxidation) -> Zinc hydroxide, releasing electrons
5) MnO2 (manganese oxide) + H2O (reduction) -> Mn2O3, ejecting hydroxide
