# Particular and general solution
Consider the system of equations $\begin{bmatrix}1&0&8&-4\\0&1&2&12\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}x_1\\x_2\\x_3\\x_4\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}42\\8\end{bmatrix}$
Because it is in [[RREF]], a solution can immediately be found by taking 42 times the first folumn and 8 times the second column
Therefore, a solution is $\begin{bmatrix}42\\8\\0\\0\end{bmatrix}$
This solution is called a [[particular solution]] or a [[special solution]]
