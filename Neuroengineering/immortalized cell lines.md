[[HeLa]]

# Methods of generation
1. Isolation from naturally occurring cancer
2. Introduction of viral gene that partially deregulates the cell cycle
3. Artificial expression of proteins required for immortality, e.g. telomerase
4. [[Hybridoma]] technology

# Examples
- 3T3 cells
- A549 cells
- HeLa cells
- HEK 293 cells
- Jurkat cells
- OK cells
- Ptk2 cells
- Vero cells
