[[neuroscience]][[ethics]][[consciousness]]

Nenad Sestan was working in his office one afternoon in 2016, when he heard two of his lab members in a room across the hall giggling with excitement over a microscope. “I knew something was happening,” he says. “I realized it was something beyond our expectations.”

The researchers, at Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut, had found electrical activity in brains taken from dead pigs. The team had painstakingly removed the organs shortly after death and infused them with oxygen and an ice-cold preservative, and in doing so, brought the brains at least partially back to life. With that shocking result, Sestan realized that what had started as a side project to find ways to better preserve brain tissue for research had morphed into a discovery that could redefine our understanding of life and death.

The excitement soon turned to concern, when the researchers thought they saw widespread, coordinated electrical activity — the type that can indicate consciousness. Sestan brought in a neurologist, who determined that the readout was actually an error, but the possibility had spooked them.

Sestan kept his cool and immediately did two things: he shut down the experiment and contacted the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), which funds his research, as well as a Yale bioethicist. Over the next few months, experts pored over the potential ethical implications, such as whether the brains could become conscious and whether physicians needed to reconsider the definition of brain death.

Sestan had anticipated the ethical questions and adopted some safeguards. Before starting the experiments, the group had decided to anaesthetize the brains with blocker drugs to prevent neurons from firing in unison — a prerequisite for consciousness.

Overall, the feat met with more excitement than concern. Sestan’s results suggested that oxygen deprivation, which can happen during a stroke or severe injury, was not as damaging to brain cells as previously thought. “It’s very important: something we overlooked, because nobody really thought that this was possible,” says Anna Devor, a biomedical engineer at Boston University in Massachusetts.

Once they were confident that the experiment was ethically sound, the researchers resumed their experiments. They submitted the work to _Nature_. But before the paper could be published, Sestan presented data at a public NIH neuroethics meeting and — despite his protests — the story appeared in the press.

Sestan admits he was amused by some of the sensationalist headlines, dubbing his project ‘Frankenswine’ and ‘Aporkalypse’. But he was stung by suggestions that the researchers were engineering immortality, or maintaining a room full of living brains in jars. Neither he nor his team wanted to discuss the results until the paper was out, but as their inboxes filled with concerns and rants from animal-rights activists and futurists, Sestan became depressed. “We were really very worried,” he says. He felt that all they could do, however, was to hold off on correcting public misunderstandings until the peer-review process had run its course.

Since the paper was published in April ([Z. Vrselja _Nature_ **568**, 336–343; 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1099-1)), the team has been so busy fielding enquiries from the media and scientists that it hasn’t performed any further experiments. Sestan wants to focus on his original questions and explore, for instance, how long the brains can be maintained for, and whether the technology can preserve other organs for transplantation.

From now on, this strand of his research will be decided by committee. “We want to get outside opinion before we do anything,” he says. “When you explore uncharted territory, you have to be very, very thoughtful.”

At the moment, there are no regulations in the United States or in Europe that would stop a researcher from creating consciousness.
