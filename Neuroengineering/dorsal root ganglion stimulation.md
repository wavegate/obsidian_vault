DRGS

implants cylindrical stimulating electrode in the intraforaminal epidural space above the DRG
due to compactness of intraforaminal space and scarcity of CSF aroudn ganglion, electrode remains close in proximity to the DRG without migration
dermatome-specific pain relief
approved by FDA in 2016 to treat intractable complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) of the lower limbs
used off-label for other pain etiologies (phantom limb pain, painful diabetic neuropathy, groin pain)
do not understand mechanism of action of pain relief
therefore, cannot optimize clinical parameters (stimulation amplitude, electrode lead position) to maximize pain relief

several hypotheses to explain therapeutic mechanism of DRGS

no clinical evidence directly supporting any one hypothesis
C-type fibers exhibit a low-pass filtering effect at the T-junction that prevents some peri
