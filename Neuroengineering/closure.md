say you have a set of integers $\mathbb{Z}={...-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3...}$
closure means if you do an operation, the result is part of that set
for example, for the operation of addition (+), -1 + 1 = 0, and 0 is part of the set, so the set is closed under addition
however, the set is not closed under division, as -1 / 3 is not in the set
