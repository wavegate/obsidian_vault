# What is a pulse stimulator?
Grass SD9 Square Pulse Stimulator
![[Pasted image 20210727103141.png]]
- Designed for student teaching
- Built-in isolation providing higher level of safety
- Voltage device only, does not generate constant current
- Generates pulses from 20 microseconds to 200 milliseconds in duration, with interpulse frequencies from 0.2 Hz to 200 Hz
- Output voltage could be defined from 100 mV to 100 V
- No software control
- 100V Monophasic, no biphasic
- Requires optional SIUs for current control
- No control over train duration/frequency

## What is a monophasic?
# What is an oscilloscope?
- Measures voltage between scope ground and tip of probe
- Travels through coaxial cable to a BNC connector
- Tip of probe can be a hook that grabs to wires or can remove it to probe different parts of circuit
- Plots voltage change over time 
- Can adjust x (time) and y (voltage) scales using knobs
- Scope ground is connected to earth through power cord which is eventually shorted to the neutral. If I accidentally connected the scope ground to the live wire I short the power lines. Can use adapter to bypass the earth ground.
- Need electrical circuit basic understanding to continue
# What does electrical stimulation do to the bath?
- Bath is artificial CSF: 124 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 20 mM HEPES, 10 mM D-glucose, 1.3 mM MgCl2, 1.5 mM CaCl2, 26 mM NaHCO3, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4
- Electrically conducting solution when dissolved in a polar solvent (water)
- Cations and anions dissolve uniformly through the solvent (solvation)
- If an electrical potential is applied to the solution, the cations are drawn to the electrode with abundance of electrons, and the anions are drawn to the electrode with a deficit of electrons
- This movement of anions and cations amounts to a current
- 
- Ions dissociate
- How well the current passes depends on how much ion is dissolved
- Can measure conductance in units of siemen (S) with conductivity probe
