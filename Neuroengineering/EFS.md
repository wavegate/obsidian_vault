# What is a pulse stimulator?
Grass SD9 Square Pulse Stimulator
![[Pasted image 20210727103141.png]]
- Designed for student teaching
- Built-in isolation providing higher level of safety
- Voltage device only, does not generate constant current
- Generates pulses from 20 microseconds to 200 milliseconds in duration, with interpulse frequencies from 0.2 Hz to 200 Hz
- Output voltage could be defined from 100 mV to 100 V
- No software control
- 100V Monophasic, no biphasic
- Requires optional SIUs for current control
- No control over train duration/frequency
