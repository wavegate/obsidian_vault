# What is a pulse stimulator?
Grass SD9 Square Pulse Stimulator
![[Pasted image 20210727103141.png]]
- Designed for student teaching
- Built-in isolation providing higher level of safety
- Voltage device only, does not generate constant current
- Generates pulses from 20 microseconds to 200 milliseconds in duration, with interpulse frequencies from 0.2 Hz to 200 Hz
- Output voltage could be defined from 100 mV to 100 V
- No software control
- 100V Monophasic, no biphasic
- Requires optional SIUs for current control
- No control over train duration/frequency

# What is an oscilloscope?
- Measures voltage between scope ground and tip of probe
- Travels through coaxial cable to a BNC connector
- Tip of probe can be a hook that grabs to wires or can remove it to probe different parts of circuit
- Plots voltage change over time 
- Can adjust x (time) and y (voltage) scales using knobs
- Scope ground is connected to earth through power cord which is eventually shorted to the neutral. If I accidentally connected the scope ground to the live wire I short the power lines. Can use adapter to bypass the earth ground.
- Need electrical circuit basic understanding to continue
# What does electrical stimulation do to the bath?
- Bath is artificial CSF: 124 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 20 mM HEPES, 10 mM D-glucose, 1.3 mM MgCl2, 1.5 mM CaCl2, 26 mM NaHCO3, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4
- Electrically conducting solution when dissolved in a polar solvent (water)
- Cations and anions dissolve uniformly through the solvent (solvation)
- If an electrical potential is applied to the solution, the cations are drawn to the electrode with abundance of electrons, and the anions are drawn to the electrode with a deficit of electrons
- When electrodes are placed in an electrolyte and a voltage is applied, the electrolyte will conduct electricity
- A chemical reaction occurs at the cathode, providing electrons to the electrolyte
- Another reaction occurs at the anode, consuming electrons from the electrolyte
- As a result, a negative charge cloud develops in the electrolyte around the cathode, and a positive charge develops around the anode
- The ions in the electrolyte neutralize these charges, enabling the electrons to keep flowing and the reactions to continue
- This movement of anions and cations amounts to a current

- For example, for NaCl in water, the cathode reaction will be 2 H2O + 2e− → 2 OH− + H2, and the anode reaction will be 2 NaCl → 2 Na+ + Cl2 + 2e−
- This means hydrogen gas will bubble up and chlorine gas will be liberated into solution where it reacts with sodium and hydroxyl ions to produce sodiu
- How well the current passes depends on how much ion is dissolved
- Can measure conductance in units of siemen (S) with conductivity probe
# What is the structure of the DRG organ?
# What happens at the cell membrane?
- Neurons are activated by electrolyte activity between the extracellular fluid and intracellular fluid
- Electrolytes enter or leave the cell membrane through ion channels
