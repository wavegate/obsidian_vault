| Reproduce, unlimited cell numbers     | Can be significantly different from the cell type they were derived from |
| Does not require experimental animals |  Must confirm results with primary neurons                                                                        |

### SH-SY5Y
- Neuroblastoma cell line that can be differentiated into mature neuron-like cells.
- Xiong et al. 2015 used low frequency, short pulse electrical field stimulation and noticed response using XRhod-1 calcium indicator.

### PC12
- Neuron-like, derived from neuroendocrine adrenal tumor; can differentiate into neuron-like cell in the presence of nerve growth factor.
