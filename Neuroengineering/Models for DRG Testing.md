### Explant protocol
- The isolated tissues were immediately placed in a Petri dish containing sterile pre-chilled non-phenol red sterile Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) (Gibco, Cat# 14025–092) ([Figure 2](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9059/8/3/49/htm#fig_body_display_biomedicines-08-00049-f002)) and transferred into the laminar flow hood. 
- All further manipulations were performed in sterile conditions. 
- Drying of the DRGs should be avoided, as this can increase the stickiness of tissue to the forceps, making it difficult to attach them to the bottom of a coverglass. 
- Four hours prior to the experiment, the frozen Matrigel growth factors reduced (MatrigelTM Basement Membrane Matrix, BD, Cat# 354230, USA) was heated up to +4 °C on ice. 
- For 3D tissue explant culture, DRGs were washed in sterile HBSS, placed in an 8-well sterile chambered borosilicate coverglass (Lab-Tek, Cat# 155411) and covered immediately with a drop (60 µL) of Matrigel and allowed to polymerize ([Figure 3](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9059/8/3/49/htm#fig_body_display_biomedicines-08-00049-f003)). 
- An increase in the volume of Matrigel drop exceeding 70 µL and Matrigel bubble formation should be avoided. 
- For 2D DRG cultures, the plates were covered with cold Matrigel and allowed to polymerize. DRGs were placed on polymerized Matrigel surface. 
- After Matrigel polymerization, the wells with 2D and 3D DRG cultures were filled with a warm Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium (RPMI) 1640 culturing media containing GlutaMAXT Supplement, Phenol Red (Gibco, Cat# 61870–010), antibiotic-antimycotic solution (100X, Gibco, Cat# 15240–096). Mouse NGF (100 ng/mL; Sigma-Aldrich, Cat# SRP4304), mouse BDNF (50 ng/mL; Abcam, Cat# ab9794), and mouse GDNF (50 ng/mL; Abcam, Cat# ab56286) or 10% bovine serum albumin (BSA), lyophilized powder, crystallized, ≥ 98.0% (GE; Sigma-Aldrich, Cat# 05470–5G) as a control were added to the culture media. 
- DRG explants were cultured in 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 14 days. 
- DRGs were analyzed using whole mount immunofluorescent staining with antibodies (whole 3D mount assay) combined with confocal microscopy.
