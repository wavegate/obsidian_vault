### SH-SY5Y
- Human euroblastoma cell line that can be differentiated into mature neuron-like cells.
- Xiong et al. 2015 used low frequency, short pulse electrical field stimulation and noticed response using XRhod-1 calcium indicator.

### NT2 (NTera)
- Human neuronally committed teratocarcinoma cell line that is able to be induced into neuronal cultures with retinoic acid and inhibitors of mitosis.

### PC12
- Neuron-like, derived from rat neuroendocrine adrenal tumor; can differentiate into neuron-like cell in the presence of nerve growth factor.

### F11 
- Sensory neurons isolated from rat DRG at embryonic days 13-14 fused with mouse neuroblastoma cell line.

### Can be purchased
- [[rat dorsal root ganglion neurons RDRGN]]

### Culture protocol
- Spin down DRG
- Remove DMEM carefully using a serological pipette
- Add Collagenase A/Dispase II Mix, shake for 15 min
- Spin down and remove Collagenase A/Dispase II
- Carefully wash pellet with 10 mL DMEM
- Remove DMEM
- Resuspend in culture media (supplemented Neurobasal media containing cytokines)
- Take 1 mL syringe and triturate the DRG solution by aspirating and ejecting the DRGs in solution 7 times up and down for each needle size starting with an 18 gauge needle, followed by a 23 gauge, and 28 gauge needle
- Remove Laminin droplet from 4 wells using vacuum so there is thin liquid layer left and immediately plate 30 microL of cell suspension on the area that is laminin coated
- Add 200 microL culture media per well
- Incubate 18-24 hr at 37 C
