| Reproduce, unlimited cell numbers     | Can be significantly different from the cell type they were derived from |
| Does not require experimental animals |  Must confirm results with primary neurons                                                                        |

| Minimal variability between cultures  |                                                                          |                                                                     |

### SH-SY5Y
- Human euroblastoma cell line that can be differentiated into mature neuron-like cells.
- Xiong et al. 2015 used low frequency, short pulse electrical field stimulation and noticed response using XRhod-1 calcium indicator.

### NT2 (NTera)
- Human neuronally committed teratocarcinoma cell line that is able to be induced into neuronal cultures with retinoic acid and inhibitors of mitosis.

### PC12
- Neuron-like, derived from rat neuroendocrine adrenal tumor; can differentiate into neuron-like cell in the presence of nerve growth factor.

### N27

### F11 
- Sensory neurons isolated from rat DRG at embryonic days 13-14 fused with mouse neuroblastoma cell line.

| Pros                                   | Cons             |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| More similar to in vivo neuronal cells | More challenging |
|                                        | Not immortal                 |
