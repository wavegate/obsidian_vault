application of fine-grained electrical stimulation to the visual pathway patterned both in space and time to replace information that once originated in the eyes
- central problem of how stimulation across multiple channels is coordinated in order to evoke a predictable, coherent visual scene
- -bipolar vs monopolar stimulation
- - [[phosphene]]
- late 1960s when Brindley and Lewin used focused electrical stimulation of the brain in blind subjects
	- 80 electrode grid implanted on the medial surface of the occipital pole of the right hemisphere (placed subdurally, without penetration of the cortex) in 52 yo woman who had lost her vision as result of bilateral glaucoma
	- 32 of 80 electrodes could evoke phosphenes
- intact inner retina and primary visual cortex
- optic nerve and LGN of thalamus
- the only systems currently approved for clinical use target the retina: Argus II, Alpha AMS, and IRIS II

despite active pre-clinical efforts in optic nerve, preferred target in the field continues to b
