connected brain organoids grown from human stem cells to walking robots, modified genomes with Neanderthal genes

August 2019 published in Cell Stem Cell reporting creation of human brain organoids that produce coordinated waves of activity resembling those seen in premature babies

experiment was shut down after months

[[ethics]]

should organoids be allowed to reach this level of advanced development?

Yale had partially restored life to brains of pigs killed hours earlier
infused brain with chemical cocktail and revived neuronal cellular function and ability to transmit electrical signals

[[complex oscillatory waves emerging from cortical organoids model early human brain network development]][[restoration of brain circulation and cellular functions hours post-mortem]]

adding human neurons to mouse brains

guidelines to guide the humane use of brain organoids?


consciousness can be indicated by EEG readings?
