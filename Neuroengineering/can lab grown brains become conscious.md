connected brain organoids grown from human stem cells to walking robots, modified genomes with Neanderthal genes

August 2019 published in Cell Stem Cell reporting creation of human brain organoids that produce coordinated waves of activity resembling those seen in premature babies

experiment was shut down after months

[[ethics]]

should organoids be allowed to reach this level of advanced development?

Yale had partially restored life to brains of pigs killed hours earlier
infused brain with chemical cocktail and revived neuronal cellular function and ability to transmit electrical signals

adding human neurons to mouse brains

guidelines to guide the humane use of brain organoids?


consciousness can be indicated by EEG readings?

organoids can't blink or recoil from painful stimulus and so can't pass clinical test for consciousness

[[integrated information theory]]: consciousness is a product of how densely neuronal networks are connected across the brain
the more neurons that interact with one another, the higher the degree of consciousness, a quantity known as phi
if phi is greater than zero, the organism is considered conscious

[[global workspace theory]] posits that brain's prefrontal cortex functions as a computer, processing sensory inputs and interpreting them to form a sense of being
because organoids don't have a prefrontal cortex and can't receive input, they cannot become conscious

2019 Lancaster grew human brain organoids next to mouse spinal column and back muscle, when connecting nerves, muscles began to spontaneously contract
