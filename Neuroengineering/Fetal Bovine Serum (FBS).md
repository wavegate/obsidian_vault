# Introduction
Fetal bovine serum (FBS) is a byproduct of harvesting cattle for the meatpacking industry—it’s used extensively by both academic and industrial researchers as a supplement to basal growth medium in cell culture applications. FBS is the liquid portion that remains after blood is drawn from bovine fetus coagulates. It’s the most widely used serum supplement for _in-vitro_ cell culture (for eukaryotic cells).[1](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/references/gibco-cell-culture-basics/cell-culture-environment/culture-media/fbs-basics/what-does-fetal-bovine-serum-do.html#reference)

# How is FBS made?
The manufacturing of FBS is highly regulated, ensuring strict safety guidelines and quality control testing.

The following is the general process of fetal bovine serum collection:

1.  As a byproduct of the meatpacking industry, fetal blood is collected at the time of harvest from abattoirs where cows pass both veterinary pre- and post-mortem inspections
2.  Fetal bovine blood is collected from deceased pregnant cows in government approved facilities
3.  Blood is drawn via cardiac puncture from the expired fetus in a closed, aseptic system using best practices to regulate hemoglobin and endotoxin levels
4.  The blood is refrigerated to encourage clotting
5.  Blood is then processed into raw serum

FBS should always be stored between ≤-10°C until its intended use.
