Fetal bovine serum (FBS) is a byproduct of harvesting cattle for the meatpacking industry—it’s used extensively by both academic and industrial researchers as a supplement to basal growth medium in cell culture applications. FBS is the liquid portion that remains after blood is drawn from bovine fetus coagulates. It’s the most widely used serum supplement for _in-vitro_ cell culture (for eukaryotic cells).[1](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/references/gibco-cell-culture-basics/cell-culture-environment/culture-media/fbs-basics/what-does-fetal-bovine-serum-do.html#reference)
