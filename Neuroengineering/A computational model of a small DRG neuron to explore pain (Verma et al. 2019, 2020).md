This is a Hodgkin-Huxley type model for a small DRG neuron consisting of four voltage-gated ion channels: sodium channels 1.7 and 1.8, delayed rectifier potassium, and A-type transient potassium channels. This model was used to explore the dynamics of this neuron using bifurcation theory, with the motive to investigate pain since small DRG neuron is a pain-sensing neuron.
