Human derived cell line
Original cell line was called SK-N-SH, isolated from bone marrow biopsy taken from 4-yo female with neuroblastoma in 1973
SK-N-SH -> SH-SY5 -> SH-SY5Y (1978)
Subcloned by selecting individual cells expressing neuron-like characteristics
Two phenotypes - floating and sticking - neuroblast-like and epithelial-like
N-type (neuronal) (as opposed to S-type SH-EP subcloned cell line)

Over-easy formation where there are mounds of undifferentiated cells which then spread differentiated cells into the surrounding area
Propagate via mitosis
Retinoic acid, BDNF, or TPA force cells to dendrify and differentiate from their clumped up nature
Retinoic acid results in inhibition of cell growth

# Media and cultivation
Most common growign cocktail is 1:1 mixture of DMEM and Ham's F12 medium and 10% supplemental fetal bovine serum
DMEM usually contains 3.7 g/L sodium bicarbonate, 2 mM L-Glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids
Cells are always grown at 37 &deg;C and 5% CO2
Cultivate cells in flasks which are coated for cell culture adhesion
Not recommended after passage 20 for very specific characteristics!

Most-reported source for access to the SH-SY5Y cell line is the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, CRL-2266, deposited by JL Biedler)
Other sources involve European Collection of Authenticated Cell Culture s(ECACCC, Catalog number: 94030304, deposited by PFT Vaughan) or the German collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSMZ, ACC 209)

ATCC recommends MEM/F12 suppelemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
DMEM was used most, followed by DMEM/F12
Media used were supplemented with antibiotics/antimycotics, glutamine, non-essential amino acids, sodium pyruvate, or other components
80% of articles media was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum

SH-SY5Y cells can be manipulated by inducing different programs of terminal neural differentiation
However, in 81.5% of published studies no differentiation regime was used
For studies that do report forced differentiation, the most common method is addition of retinoic acid (RA) in concentrations ranging from 5 uM to 100 uM, for a period of time from 24 hours to 21 days, and, sometimes, a reduction of the concentration of serum in the media
