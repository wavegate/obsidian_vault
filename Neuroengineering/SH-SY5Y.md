Human derived cell line
Original cell line was called SK-N-SH, isolated from bone marrow biopsy taken from 4-yo female with neuroblastoma in 1973
SK-N-SH -> SH-SY5 -> SH-SY5Y (1978)
Subcloned by selecting individual cells expressing neuron-like characteristics
Two phenotypes - floating and sticking - neuroblast-like and epithelial-like
N-type (neuronal) (as opposed to S-type SH-EP subcloned cell line)
