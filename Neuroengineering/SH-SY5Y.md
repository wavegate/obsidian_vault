## Reagents
1.  [Dulbecco’s Minimum Essential Medium (DMEM)/F-12](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/10565018#/10565018)
	- DMEM/F-12 is a 1:1 mixture of DMEM and Ham's F-12. This formulation combines DMEM's high concentrations of glucose, amino acids, and vitamins with F-12's wide variety of components. DMEM/F-12 with [GlutaMAX™](http://www.invitrogen.com/site/us/en/home/Products-and-Services/Applications/Cell-Culture/Mammalian-Cell-Culture/media-supplements/GlutaMAX-Media.html) supplement minimizes toxic ammonia build-up and improves cell viability and growth in an easy-to-use format. DMEM/F-12 contains no proteins, lipids, or growth factors. Therefore, DMEM/F-12 may require supplementation, commonly with 10% [Fetal Bovine Serum](http://www.invitrogen.com/site/us/en/home/Products-and-Services/Applications/Cell-Culture/Mammalian-Cell-Culture/fbs.html) (FBS). DMEM/F-12 uses a sodium bicarbonate buffer system and therefore requires a 5–10% CO2 environment to maintain physiological pH.
	- $49.40 for 500 mL
2. [[Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS)]], 10 % final concentration
	- Serum offers a highly bioavailable complex of proteins and amino acids, lipids and triglycerides, vitamins, inorganic minerals and salts, as well as other minor components and growth factors that promote culture success. Serum may also contain varying concentrations of iron sequestering heme and mitogenic endotoxin.
	- $605 for 500 mL, can try 50 mL free sample
	- Cheaper alternative: [FetalPlex™](https://www.gembio.com/product/fetalplextm-animal-serum-complex) is an engineered complex of animal sera, supplemented with a defined blend of vitamins, amino acids, triglycerides and trace elements. This proprietary formulation yields a serum that will, for many routine applications, replace fetal bovine serum at a much lower cost. Biochemical characteristics are comparable to fetal bovine serum, except for an increase in the total protein content. Also, cholesterol levels are slightly higher than in fetal bovine sera. FetalPlex™ is not intended to replace fetal bovine serum where low total-protein concentrations are critical, or where the trouble-free biochemistry of FBS is the only choice for fastidious cell lines or specialized applications. FetalPlex™ has proven useful and cost-effective for the growth and maintenance of a broad range of cell types.
	- $205 for 500 mL
3.  [Penicillin/Streptomycin (Pen/Strep), 1 % final concentration (100 IU/ml, 100 µg/ml, respectively).](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/15070063#/15070063)
	- The antibiotics penicillin and streptomycin are used to prevent bacterial contamination of cell cultures due to their effective combined action against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
	- $20.58 for 100mL (5,000 U/mL)
4.  [Trypsin/EDTA.](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/R001100#/R001100)
	- Gibco® Trypsin solutions are made from trypsin powder - a mixture of proteases derived from bovine pancreas. Due to its digestive strength, it is widely used for cell dissociation, during routine cell culture passaging and primary tissue dissociation.
	- $29.23 for 100 mL
5.  [Neurobasal medium (NB).](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/21103049#/21103049)
	- Neurobasal Medium is a basal medium designed for long-term maintenance and maturation of pure pre-natal and embryonic neuronal cell populations without the need for an astrocyte feeder layer when used with [Gibco B-27 supplements](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/brands/gibco/gibco-b-27-supplement.html).
	- $77.25 for 500 mL
	- There is a [B-27 + Neurobasal Medium sample.](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/global/forms/life-science/b27-plus-neuronal-culture-system-sample.html)
6.  B27 supplement.
	- The most cited neuronal cell culture supplement, B-27 Supplement is an optimized serum-free supplement used to support the low- or high-density growth and short- or long-term viability of embryonic, post-natal, and adult hippocampal and other CNS neurons.
	- $107.00 for 10 mL
7.  GlutaMAX. (included above)

### 3.1 Initial Culture Conditions

1.  Prepare growth medium: DMEM/F12 (1:1, v:v) medium, (10 % FBS and 1 % pen/strep) and filter through a 0.22 µm pore filter apparatus.
    
2.  Obtain cells from the ATCC (ATCC® CRL-2266) and thaw quickly at 37 °C.
    
3.  Gently remove cell suspension from tube and add to a T-75 tissue culture flask containing warm (37 °C) growth medium (_see_ [Note 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5127451/#FN1)).
    
4.  Culture cells at 37 °C, 5 % CO2. Growth medium should be refreshed every 4–7 days (_see_ [Note 2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5127451/#FN2)). Monitor cells for confluence. When cells reach 80–90 % confluence, subculture as described below.
    

### 3.2 Sub-culture Conditions

1.  Aspirate medium under sterile conditions. If a number of floating cells are present, medium can be collected and centrifuged so non-adherent cells can be recovered and re-plated.
    
2.  Rinse adherent cells once with sterile 1× PBS pre-warmed to 37 °C or room temperature (_see_ [Note 3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5127451/#FN3)). To prevent detaching cells, add the PBS to the inside surface of the culture flask that does not have cells attached. Do not add PBS directly onto cell monolayer. Gently tip the flask so that the PBS washes over the cell monolayer. Aspirate PBS.
    
3.  Add trypsin to adherent cells for approximately 2 min or until cells visibly detach from culture flask (_see_ [Note 4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5127451/#FN4)).
    
4.  Neutralize trypsin by adding an equal volume of DMEM/F12 medium containing 10 % FBS.
    
5.  Collect detached cell suspension and centrifuge at 1,500 rpm for 5 min at room temperature to concentrate cell pellet.
    
6.  Aspirate supernatant carefully without disturbing the cell pellet.
    
7.  Gently suspend pellet in DMEM/F12 medium containing 10 % FBS.
    
8.  To separate cells from clumps, pipette up and down gently until the suspension appears homogenous (_see_ [Note 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5127451/#FN1)).
    
9.  Count cells using a hemocytometer and plate at approximately 3 × 103 to 1 × 105 cells/cm2 (_see_ [Note 5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5127451/#FN5)).
    

### 3.3 Differentiation

1.  24–48 h after plating, replace serum-containing medium with Neurobasal medium (containing B27 supplement and GlutaMAX) and 10 µM all-_trans_-retinoic acid (ATRA) to promote differentiation and neuronal phenotype.
    
2.  Allow cells to grow in ATRA-containing neurobasal medium for a minimum of 3–5 days, refreshing the medium every 48 h.
    
3.  Differentiation can be monitored microscopically via morphological assessment of neurite outgrowth (compare [Figs. 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5127451/figure/F1/) and [​and22](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5127451/figure/F2/)).
    

### 3.4 Freezing Down

1.  To freeze down _SH-SY5Y_ cells, begin with undifferentiated cultures.
    
2.  Harvest 80–90 % confluent monolayer from a T75 flask and pellet cells as described above (_see_ [Note 6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5127451/#FN6)).
    
3.  Suspend the cell pellet gently in 1 ml of 90 % FBS, 10 % DMSO in a sterile 1.5 ml screw cap vial appropriate for storage in the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen.
    
4.  Store cells at −80 °C for approximately 24 h in an insulated cryobox and then transfer tubes to liquid nitrogen for long-term storage.
