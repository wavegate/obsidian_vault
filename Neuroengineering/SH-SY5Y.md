Human derived cell line
Original cell line was called SK-N-SH, isolated from bone marrow biopsy taken from 4-yo female with neuroblastoma in 1973
SK-N-SH -> SH-SY5 -> SH-SY5Y (1978)
Subcloned by selecting individual cells expressing neuron-like characteristics
Two phenotypes - floating and sticking - neuroblast-like and epithelial-like
N-type (neuronal) (as opposed to S-type SH-EP subcloned cell line)

Over-easy formation where there are mounds of undifferentiated cells which then spread differentiated cells into the surrounding area
Propagate via mitosis
Retinoic acid, BDNF, or TPA force cells to dendrify and differentiate from their clumped up nature
Retinoic acid results in inhibition of cell growth

# Media and cultivation
Most common growign cocktail is 1:1 mixture of DMEM and Ham's F12 medium and 10% supplemental fetal bovine serum
DMEM usually contains 3.7 g/L sodium bicarbonate, 2 mM L-Glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids
Cells are always grown at 37 &deg;C and 5% CO2
Cultivate cells in flasks which are coated for cell culture adhesion
Not recommended after passage 20 for very specific characteristics!
