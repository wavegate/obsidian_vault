 In this study, investigators from KU Leuven in Belgium injected human embryonic stem cell-derived cortical pyramidal neurons into the mouse cortex in presence of EGTA—a Ca2+ ion chelator that dissociates adherens junctions—to facilitate cell integration into the brain. Brain examination 24 h after transplantation revealed that GFP+ human cells had integrated as single cells within the mouse cortex and were migrating along radial glia processes. At later stages, from 2 weeks to 1 month post-transplantation, human neurons were found within the cortical gray matter from deep to superficial cortical layers, confirming their successful integration in the mouse cortex.
