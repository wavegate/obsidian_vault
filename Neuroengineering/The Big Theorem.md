# Geometric problem
- Suppose we have a list of vectors $\vec{a_{1}},...,\vec{a_n}$
- Is the span, or linear combinations, of these vectors the entire space $\mathbb{R}^m$?
- In other words, is $\operatorname{span}\{\vec{a_{1}},...,\vec{a_n}\} = \mathbb{R}^m$?
- Note that there are $m$ vectors, but each of these vectors has $n$ components.
- If our vectors are in line with each other, their span does not make up $\mathbb{R}^m$.
- Or, if all vectors are in one plane, then span is just one plane and not the entire 3D space.
