SH-SY5Y is a thrice-cloned sub-line of bone marrow biopsy-derived line SK-N-SH (Sigma catalogue no. 86012802). SH-SY-5Y has dopamine-β-hydroxylase activity and can convert glutamate to the neurotransmitter GABA. Will form tumours in nude mice in approximately 3-4 weeks. The loss of neuronal characteristics has been described with increasing passage numbers. Therefore it is recommended to verify specific characteristics such as noradrenalin uptake or neuronal markers routinely.

# Culture medium
[Ham′s F12:](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/product/sigma/N4888).

# Subculture routine
Split sub-confluent cultures (70-80%) 1:10 to 1:100 i.e. seeding at 1x1,000-1x10,000 cells/cm2; using 0.25% [Trypsin or](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/product/sigma/T4424) , 5% CO2; 37°C. Cells may reattach slowly and may remain in suspension for several days. The loss of neuronal characteristics has been described with increasing passage numbers. Therefore it is recommended to verify specific characteristics such as noradrenalin uptake or neuronal markers routinely.
