SH-SY5Y is a thrice-cloned sub-line of bone marrow biopsy-derived line SK-N-SH (Sigma catalogue no. 86012802). SH-SY-5Y has dopamine-Î²-hydroxylase activity and can convert glutamate to the neurotransmitter GABA. Will form tumours in nude mice in approximately 3-4 weeks. The loss of neuronal characteristics has been described with increasing passage numbers. Therefore it is recommended to verify specific characteristics such as noradrenalin uptake or neuronal markers routinely.
