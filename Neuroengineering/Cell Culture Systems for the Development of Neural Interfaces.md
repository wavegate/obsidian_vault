# Cells and ECM Components of the Nervous System
- 171 billion cells, divided almost equally into neuronal and non-neuronal cells
- Non-neuronal cells include microglia, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, endothelial cells and pericytes
- Gliosis in CNS is driven by astrocytes whereas in the PNS is driven by Schwann cells
- ECM provides biochemical cues such as soluble factors, growth factors, chemokines, and cytokines
- In most human tissues, ECM structurally consists of fibronectin, collagen, elastin, laminin
- However, in the brain, it is mainly composed of hyaluronic acid (HA) and proteoglycans, especially glycosaminoglycans (GAGs)
- The simplest approach to maintain ECM inte
