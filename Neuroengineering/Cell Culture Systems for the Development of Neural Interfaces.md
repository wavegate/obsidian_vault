# Cells and ECM Components of the Nervous System
- 171 billion cells, divided almost equally into neuronal and non-neuronal cells
- Non-neuronal cells include microglia, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, endothelial cells and pericytes
- Gliosis in CNS is driven by astrocytes whereas in the PNS is driven by Schwann cells
- ECM provides biochemical cues such as soluble factors, growth factors, chemokines, and cytokines
- In most human tissues, ECM structurally consists of fibronectin, collagen, elastin, laminin
- However, in the brain, it is mainly composed of hyaluronic acid (HA) and proteoglycans, especially glycosaminoglycans (GAGs)
- The simplest approach to maintain ECM interactions is to use intact tissue as a model in the form of explants for ex vivo models

# Explant and Ex Vivo Approaches
- Explants provide the most realistic replication of the 3D cellular environment in vitro, but can suffer from lack of longevity, degradation of 3D microenvironment during culture period, and challenging preparation steps
- The use of these preparations is strongly recommended when cellular connectivity and replication of the in vivo environment are important parameters

# Explant Culture Types
- For slice cultures of the brain, hundreds of micrometre-thick slices are cut using a vibratome or tissue slicer and secured to a semi-porous membrane culture substrate
- These cultures are kept in stable in vitro conditions fro weeks to months
- Normal synaptic transmission and excitation is maintained
- Ex vivo culturing of the DRG can be done using tissue from embryonic, postnatal and adult animals
- Typically, embryonic DRG are used for ex vivo preparations owing to the high content of neurons that can be isolated

- These preparations are particularly useful when investigating pharmaceutical interactions due to the known afferent fibre composition
- Additionally, the morphology of the explant enables control of the sprouted neurites, leading to easy compartmentalization and use with microfluidic systems
