# Cells and ECM Components of the Nervous System
- 171 billion cells, divided almost equally into neuronal and non-neuronal cells
- Non-neuronal cells include microglia, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, endothelial cells and pericytes
- Gliosis in CNS is driven by astrocytes whereas in the PNS is driven by Schwann cells
- ECM provides biochemical cues such as soluble factors, growth factors, chemokines, and cytokines
- In most human tissues, ECM structurally consists of fibronectin, collagen, elastin, laminin
- However, in the brain, it is mainly composed of hyaluronic acid (HA) and proteoglycans, especially glycosaminoglycans (GAGs)
- The simplest approach to maintain ECM interactions is to use intact tissue as a model in the form of explants for ex vivo models

# Explant and Ex Vivo Approaches
- Explants provide the most realistic replication of the 3D cellular environment in vitro, but can suffer from lack of longevity, degradation of 3D microenvironment during culture period, and challenging preparation steps
- The use of these preparations is strongly recommended when cellular connectivity and replication of the in vivo environment are important parameters
