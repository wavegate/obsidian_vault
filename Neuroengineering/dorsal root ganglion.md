bulge in posterior spinal root, located bilaterally in the intraforaminal space at each spinal vertebral level
contains cell bodies of all primary sensory neurons innervating that dermatome governed by spinal segmental level

beginning of all somatosensory pathways except for those in the head

responsible for thermoception (sensing temperature), nociception (feeling pain), mechanoreception (sensing pressure) and proprioception (sensing body spatial position)

peripheral DRG branch has axonal hallmarks
- site of axon potential generation
- uniform iameter
- myelinated in some cases
- positive for the somatodendritic marker microtublue-associated protein 2 (MAP2) raising the hypothesis that at the molecular level it has some dendritic-like features
