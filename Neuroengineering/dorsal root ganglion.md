bulge in posterior spinal root, located bilaterally in the intraforaminal space at each spinal vertebral level
contains cell bodies of all primary sensory neurons innervating that dermatome governed by spinal segmental level

beginning of all somatosensory pathways except for those in the head

responsible for thermoception (sensing temperature), nociception (feeling pain), mechanoreception (sensing pressure) and proprioception (sensing body spatial position)

peripheral DRG branch has axonal hallmarks
- site of axon potential generation
- uniform iameter
- myelinated in some cases
- positive for the somatodendritic marker microtublue-associated protein 2 (MAP2) raising the hypothesis that at the molecular level it has some dendritic-like features

- a lot of heterogeneity
- originate from neural crest (in contrast t oneural tube like CNS)
- migrate ventrally to the DRG between E8.5 and E10 in the mouse
- specified from cell progeny of neural crest cells in two overlapping successive waves controlled by neurogenin 1 and 2

supported by two types of glial cells: satellite glial cells (SGCs) and Schwann cells
- SGCs interact with the cell bodies and initial part of the stem axon
- Schwann cells envelop distal part of stem axon adn both peripheral and central axons

- cell bodies are completely wrapped by sheaths that may have one or sveeral layers of SGCs
