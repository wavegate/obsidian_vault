how to convert raw data into [[feature]]

string features can be handled with one-hot encoding

feature values should appear with non-zero value more than a small handful of times in the dataset

should have a clear, obvious meaning

don't take on "magic" values

definition shouldn't change over time

distribution should not have extreme outliers
