conduction band is a ring outside of which the elctrons can escape

conductors have conduction band on the valence shell, so electrons escape easily

insulators have valence shell far within the conduction band so electrons do not escape easily

semiconductors have them close together, so if you provide energy, the electrons can jump out

pure silicon has almost no free electrons, so engineers dope with another material to change the properties -> P-type and N-type

P-type and N-type combine to make a diode
