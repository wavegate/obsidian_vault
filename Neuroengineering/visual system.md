- eye focuses light onto photosensitive cells in the retina that transduce photons into neural signals
- after processing within the retina, the retinal ganglion cells (RGC) send the signals along their axons which exit the eye in a bundle to form the optic nerve
- -optic nerve carries visual information to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) within the thalamus
- [[anatomy]]
- [[vision]]
- LGN in turn sends output through optic radiation to primary visual cortex, V1, where signals branch out to other higher-order centers
- [[phosphene]]
- late 1960s when Brindley and Lewin used focused electrical stimulation of the brain in blind subjects
	- 80 electrode grid implanted on the medial surface of the occipital pole of the right hemisphere (placed subdurally, without penetration of the cortex) in 52 yo woman who had lost her vision as result of bilateral glaucoma
	- 32 of 80 electrodes could evoke phosphenes
- intact inner retina and primary visual cortex
- optic nerve and LGN of thalamus
- the only systems currently approved for clinical use target the retina: Argus II, Alpha AMS, and IRIS II
