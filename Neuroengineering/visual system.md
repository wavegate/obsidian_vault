- eye focuses light onto photosensitive cells in the retina that transduce photons into neural signals
- after processing within the retina, the retinal ganglion cells (RGC) send the signals along their axons which exit the eye in a bundle to form the optic nerve
- -optic nerve carries visual information to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) within the thalamus
