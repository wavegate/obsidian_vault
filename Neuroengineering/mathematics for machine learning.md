two ways to read this book
bottom up:
- building up from concepts from foundational to more advanced
- preferred approach in more technical fields such as mathematics
- reader is at all times able to rely on prevoiusly learned concepts
- many foundational concepts are not particularly interesting by themselves
- lack of motivation means most foundatoinal definitions are quickly forgotten
top-down:
- from practical needs to more basic requirements
- readers know at all times why they need to work on a particular concept
- clear path of required knowledge
- potentially shaky foundations
- have to remember a set of words that they do not have any way of understanding

pillars of machine learning: regression, dimensionality reduction, density estimation, and classification

we represent numerical data as vectors and represent a table of such data as a matrix
the study of vectors and matrices is called [[linear algebra]]

vectors that are similar should be predicted to have similar outputs by our machine learning algorithm (our predictor)
