[[linear algebra]]
- Transformation of a vector is similar to a function.
- a transformation $T:\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^m$ aka $T(\vec{x})=\vec{y}$
- There is a unique output for every input.
- $\mathbb{R}^n$ is the domain and $\mathbb{R}^m$ is the codomain


# Examples
Expansion = makes the vector longer/shorter
Reflection = reflects the vector across x=y
