mainstay of refractory pain management for decades
implants electrode arrays in epidural space dorsal to spinal cord

[[neuromodulation]]
apply electrical impulses to innervate patient's painful regions, which evokes paresthetic (tingling) sensations in those regions
limited success for focal pain due to difficulty targeting certain regions of the body
highly conductive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) around spinal cord can shunt electrical current away from the targeted region
leads prone to migration over time
change in posture can affect position of the spinal cord relative to electrode lead
