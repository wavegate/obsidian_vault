[[dorsal root ganglion]][[immortalized cell lines]]

# Cell lines

## ECACC
[[SH-SY5Y cell line, human, neuroblast from neural tissue]]
U-87 MG cell line, human, from human brain (glioblastoma astrocytoma)
Neuro 2a cell line, mouse
ND7/23 cell line

use of immortalized cell lines have many advantages including long-term growth and ease to cultivate
neural stem cells (NSCs) are used as they have added benefit of self-renewal and differentiation along specific pathways to generate specific phenotypes

## mouse
GT1-7 mouse hypothalamic gnrh neuronal cell line - GnRH-secreting neurons of the hypothalamus
O9-1 mouse cranial neural crest cell line
cryopreserved mouse crotical neural stem cells
cryopreserved mouse spinal cord neural stem cells from spinal cord of E15-E18 C57/BL6 mice

## rat
N27 Rat dopaminergic neural crest line
adult rat hippocampal neural stem cells

## human
- blood-brain barrier hcMEC/D3 cell line - brain endothelial phenotype, model of human BBB
- ReNcell CX human neural progenitor cell line - can differntiate into neurons & glia

# Primary
rat cortical neurons
[[rat dorsal root ganglion neurons RDRGN]]

# Genetic modification

![[Pasted image 20210717140434.png]]

CompoZr ZFN and CRISPR allow researchers to knock-out, knock-in and modify genes to create their ideal cell model

[[CRISPR]]

# Optimize growth and consistency

## Neurite outgrowth
[[AXIS axon isolation system]]

## Growth environment
3D cell culture

## Media and growth factors
GS21 Supplement (50X) serum-free Neural Media Supplement
NeuralQ Basal Medium

## Sterile filtration
Stericup and Steritop filter units - remove undesirable contaminants and sterilize media
Millex syringe filters
