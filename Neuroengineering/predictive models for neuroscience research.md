[[dorsal root ganglia]][[immortalized cell lines]]

# Immortal

use of immortalized cell lines have many advantages including long-term growth and ease to cultivate
neural stem cells (NSCs) are used as they have added benefit of self-renewal and differentiation along specific pathways to generate specific phenotypes

## mouse
GT1-7 mouse hypothalamic gnrh neuronal cell line - GnRH-secreting neurons of the hypothalamus
O9-1 mouse cranial neural crest cell line
cryopreserved mouse crotical neural stem cells
cryopreserved mouse spinal cord neural stem cells from spinal cord of E15-E18 C57/BL6 mice

## rat
N27 Rat dopaminergic neural crest line
adult rat hippocampal neural stem cells

## human
blood-brain barrier hcMEC/D3 cell line - brain endothelial phenotype, model of human BBB
ReNcell CX human neural progenitor cell line - can differntiate into neurons & glia

# Primary

## rat
rat cortical neurons
[[rat dorsal root ganglion neurons RDRGN]]
