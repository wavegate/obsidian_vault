[[dorsal root ganglia]][[immortalized cell lines]]

use of immortalized cell lines have many advantages including long-term growth and ease to cultivate
neural stem cells (NSCs) are used as they have added benefit of self-renewal and differentiation along specific pathways to generate specific phenotypes
