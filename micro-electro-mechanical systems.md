**MEMS 5801 - Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems I**- Introduction to MEMS: Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) are ubiquitous in chemical, biomedical, and industrial (e.g., automotive, aerospace, printing) applications. This course will cover important topics in MEMS design, micro-/nanofabrication, and their implementation in real-world devices. The course will include discussion of fabrication and measurement technologies (e.g., physical/chemical deposition, lithography, wet/dry etching, and packaging), as well as application of MEMS theory to design/fabrication of devices in a cleanroom. Lectures will cover specific processes and how those processes enable the structures needed for accelerometers, gyros, FR filters, digital mirrors, microfluidics, micro total-analysis systems, biomedical implants, etc. The laboratory component will allow students to investigate those processes first-hand by fabricating simple MEMS devices.
